# Optional, both. Changes outside $HOME around a real install. pre_install
# runs before any file is placed — stop services running from the package's
# directory, which a reinstall deletes and copies again; non-zero stops the
# install with nothing placed. post_install runs after the files and settings,
# before verify_probe; non-zero fails the install. Each gets $1: "install" the
# first time, "reinstall" when the package's files were already there. Neither
# runs on --dry-run or when KIT_SKIP_MACHINE_HOOKS=1 (the tests set it). Both
# must be safe to run again.

# Optional, both. Run by update.sh with $1 the installed version and $2 the
# new one, from the new release's manifest.sh. pre_update runs before the new
# files are unpacked; non-zero stops the update with nothing changed.
# post_update runs after install.sh succeeds; use it to migrate from an older
# version. Skipped with --dry-run and when KIT_SKIP_MACHINE_HOOKS=1.

# Optional. Runs in uninstall.sh before anything is removed, while the files
# are still installed: stop services started from the package's directory.

# Optional. Runs in uninstall.sh after everything is removed, to undo a change

# KIT_SKIP_MACHINE_HOOKS=1. Non-zero is reported; nothing is put back.
